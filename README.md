# Badbank
# Description
This purpose of this project was to create an a simple full stack banking application with a layer of security. This will guide a new developer in creating his or her own multi-tier projects. One of the problems it solves is the seperation of concerns. The load of work for the application is spread out in different tiers. The user can plug in their data into the front-end and it will get stored in a scalable data store in the back-end.
